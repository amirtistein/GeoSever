"# GeoSever" 
First, I uploaded the data to GeoServer and generated the link for this information.

Then I designed the web page using HTML and CSS and allocated a section of the page for map display using the OpenLayers library.

Calling the layer created in GeoServer and overlay it on the base map layer.

Also adding a layer switcher with the ability to toggle layers on and off.

I added the Identify feature to the web-based map.

Add the capability to add new point features.

The capability to add new point features and to calculate area and length on the map is also added.
